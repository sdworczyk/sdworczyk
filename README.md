### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a coding student for a Data Science course. 
I am currently learning how to code in Python and hopefully will persue a career using the language. 
I am looking to work in the industry and use the programming language to help my future aspiration of getting a PhD in Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology.
